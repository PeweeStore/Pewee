# Roadmap

## High priority

* APK uploading (Integrity checking, copy)
* HTTPS finalization (app config certificate path and create HTTPS server)
* Better design (bootstrap usage)

## Normal priority

* Respond to custom web hook services (Github, Jenkins, GitLab, etc)
* Capacity to send mail to a person or a person list when upload done
* Do unit testing (TDD/BDD) to keep functionality
* Build a CLI-tool for easify the upload of app (IPA first, APK later)
* add i18n (with <https://github.com/mashpie/i18n-node> ?)

## Low priority

* Give an UI for manager app settings and more tools
